Sphinx Documentation Usage
=====

Support for readthdocs integration will be added in the future.

Documentation for the python package can currently be generated by running Sphinx. 
To install sphinx, follow the instructions [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).

Then run
```
cd docs
sphinx-apidoc -o _source ../drl/ '../drl/tests/*'
make html
```
and navigate to ```file://<PATH_TO_REPO>/docs/_build/html/index.html``` in a browser to view the HTML-rendered documentation.
